# etch-a-sketch

Etch-a-Sketch project from The Odin Project Foundations Course

Prompt: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

Post project reflection:
I wouldn't really call this as an Etch-e-Sketch, but this is more entertaining, so I'll let it slide.

Most of my time was spent trying to convert RGB to HSL and I ended up just storing the original/updated HSL values instead of doing any calculations...If it works, it works. ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
