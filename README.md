## Introduction

In this project, you’ll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex your DOM manipulation skills. You’re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

This project should not be easy. You’ll probably have to Google frequently to find the right JavaScript methods and CSS to use – in fact, that’s the point! You can build this using the tools that you have already learned. There are plenty of resources on the net for learning stuff that we haven’t covered yet if you decide you need it. We’ll walk you through the basic steps, but it will be up to you to actually implement them.

If you get totally stuck, drop by and ask for help in our Discord server. Someone will be there to point you in the right direction.

## Post project reflection:

I wouldn't really call this as an Etch-e-Sketch, but this is more entertaining, so I'll let it slide.

Most of my time was spent trying to convert RGB to HSL and I ended up just storing the original/updated HSL values instead of doing any calculations...If it works, it works. ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
